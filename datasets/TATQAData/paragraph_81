Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Principal Accountant Fees and Services
The following table presents fees for professional audit services rendered by Brightman Almagor Zohar & Co., a Firm in the Deloitte Global Network (“Deloitte”) for the audit of our financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and fees billed for other services rendered by Deloitte during those periods.
(1) Audit fees are comprised of fees for professional services performed by Deloitte for the audit of our annual financial statements and the review of our quarterly financial statements, as well as other services provided by Deloitte in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements.
(2) Tax fees are comprised of fees for preparation of tax returns to the Company and the services performed by Deloitte in connection with Inter-Company matters.
We did not use Deloitte for financial information system design and implementation. These services, which include designing or implementing a system that aggregates source data underlying the financial statements and generates information that is significant to our financial statements, are provided internally or by other service providers. We did not engage Deloitte to provide compliance outsourcing services.
