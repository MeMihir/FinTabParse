The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):
The Company considered both positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, historic book profit/loss, prior taxable income/loss, and results of future operations, and determined that a valuation allowance was not required for a significant portion of its deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance of $31.4 million and $28.5 million remained as of July 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
The increase of $2.9 million in the valuation allowance in the current fiscal year relates primarily to net operating losses and income tax credits incurred in certain tax jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized.
