Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
Significant components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are summarized below (in thousands):
Based on the Companyâ€™s historical operating income, projection of future taxable income, scheduled reversal of taxable temporary differences, and tax planning strategies, management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances recorded. The net increase in the total valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 is primarily related to the increase of a net operating loss carry forward due to a release of a non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefit and the increase of deferred tax assets in sites with existing valuation allowances. The decrease in domestic federal and state tax credits is primarily related to the utilization of tax credits against the one-time transition tax.
As of August 31, 2019, the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest the remaining earnings from its foreign subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not already been recorded. The accumulated earnings are the most significant component of the basis difference which is indefinitely reinvested. As of August 31, 2019, the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which taxes had not been provided were approximately $1.9 billion. The estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these reinvested earnings was approximately $0.2 billion.
