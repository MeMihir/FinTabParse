Recently adopted authoritative guidance
Revenue Recognition — Contracts with Customers. In May 2014, the FASB issued new authoritative guidance for revenue from contracts with customers. The standard’s core principle is that a company recognizes revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, companies are required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs, including commissions paid, when contracts are signed. The asset recognized from capitalized incremental and recoverable acquisition costs is amortized on a straight-line basis consistent with the timing of transfer of the products or services to which the asset relates.
As a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, our net revenue for fiscal 2019 increased $47 million, and our operating expenses decreased $12 million. See Note 3 for additional information related to the impact of the new guidance on the timing and amounts of revenues recognized in fiscal 2019.
The effects of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on our March 29, 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:
(1) As reported includes short-term deferred commissions of $92 million. The balance without adoption of new standard includes short-term deferred commissions of $81 million.
(2) As reported includes long-term deferred commissions of $93 million. The balance without adoption of new standard includes long-term deferred commissions of $44 million.
