Horizon Clinicals and Series2000 Revenue Cycle Discontinued Operation
Two of the product offerings acquired with the EIS Business in 2017, Horizon Clinicals and Series2000 Revenue Cycle, were sunset after March 31, 2018. The decision to discontinue maintaining and supporting these solutions was made prior to our acquisition of the EIS Business and, therefore, they are presented below as discontinued operations.
Until the end of the first quarter of 2018, we were involved in ongoing maintenance and support for these solutions until customers transitioned to other platforms. No disposal gains or losses were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to these discontinued solutions. We had $0.9 million of accrued expenses associated with the Horizon Clinicals and Series2000 Revenue Cycle businesses on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018
The following table summarizes the major income and expense line items of these discontinued solutions, as reported in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:
