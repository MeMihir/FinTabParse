Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by our growth, ability to maintain our contractual billing and collection terms, and our investments in headcount and infrastructure to support anticipated growth. Given the seasonality and continued growth of our business, our cash flows from operations will vary from period to period.
Cash provided by operating activities was $115.5 million in 2019, compared to $90.3 million in 2018. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to improved profitability, improved collections, and other working capital changes in 2019 when compared to 2018.
