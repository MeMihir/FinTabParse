NOTE 16 â€” Stock-Based Compensation
At December 31, 2019, we had five stock-based compensation plans: the Non-Employee Directors' Stock Retirement Plan
("Directors' Plan"), the 2004 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2004 Plan"), the 2009 Omnibus Equity and Performance
Incentive Plan ("2009 Plan"), the 2014 Performance & Incentive Plan ("2014 Plan"), and the 2018 Equity and Incentive
Compensation Plan ("2018 Plan"). Future grants can only be made under the 2018 Plan.
These plans allow for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance
shares, performance units, and other stock awards subject to the terms of the specific plans under which the awards are granted.
The following table summarizes the compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to stock-based compensation plans:
The fair value of all equity awards that vested during the periods ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $6,589, $5,805, and $5,471, respectively. We recorded a tax deduction related to equity awards that vested during the year ended December 31, 2019, in the amount of $1,489.
