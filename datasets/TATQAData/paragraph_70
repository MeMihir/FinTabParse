The tax credit/(charge) for the period differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom of 19.0% (2017/18: 19.0%). The reasons for this are explained below:
The movements in losses recognised for the period ended 30 March 2019 is £nil (2017/18: £1.1m). Corporation tax losses are not recognised where future recoverability is uncertain.
The adjustments to prior periods of £1.7m (2017/18: £(8.1m)) relate mainly to the adjustment of prior period losses and capital allowances which have been revised following submission of tax returns.
