Cost of Revenue:
The $29.3 million increase in our cost of license and subscription revenue was primarily attributable to increases of $14.9 million in personnel expenses, $8.6 million in cloud infrastructure costs incurred in order to support the growth of our subscription offerings, $3.3 million in royalties, $1.8 million in professional services, and $0.9 million related to the amortization of internal-use software development and acquired intangible assets.
Cloud infrastructure costs include $9.5 million of hosting related costs that were recorded in cost of services revenue in fiscal year 2018. The treatment of these hosting related costs is consistent with the treatment of the related revenue in each fiscal year.
We anticipate higher cost of license and subscription revenue as we continue to invest in our cloud operations to increase operational efficiency and scale while growing our customer base. Cost of maintenance revenue increased by $1.7 million primarily due to the increase in personnel required to support our term and perpetual license customers.
Our cost of services revenue would have increased if cloud infrastructure costs totaling $9.5 million were not reclassified to cost of license and subscription revenue, consistent with the treatment of the related revenue. Excluding the impact of this reclassification, third-party consultants billable to customers primarily for InsuranceNow implementation engagements increased by $3.2 million and personnel expenses related to new and existing employees increased by $2.8 million.
We had 781 professional service employees and 198 technical support and licensing operations employees at July 31, 2019 compared to 838 professional services employees and 121 technical support and licensing operations employees at July 31, 2018.
