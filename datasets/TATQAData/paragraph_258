26. Derivative Financial Instruments (Continued)
The fair value of the derivative liabilities is as follows:
Interest rate swap agreements
The Group enters into interest rate swap agreements which convert the floating interest rate exposure into a fixed interest rate in order to hedge a portion of the Groupâ€™s exposure to fluctuations in prevailing market interest rates. Under the interest rate swaps, the bank counterparty effects quarterly floating-rate payments to the Group for the notional amount based on the U.S. dollar LIBOR, and the Group effects quarterly payments to the bank on the notional amount at the respective fixed rates.
Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments
As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, there are no interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments for accounting purposes.
