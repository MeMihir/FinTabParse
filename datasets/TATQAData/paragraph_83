Income from vessel operations for Teekay LNG increased to $299.3 million in 2019 compared to $148.6 million in 2018, primarily as a result of:
• an increase of $53.1 million as a result of write-downs in 2018 of three conventional tankers and four multi-gas vessels and the sales of the Teide Spirit, European Spirit, African Spirit, Toledo Spirit and Alexander Spirit, partially offset by a write-down of the Alexander Spirit in the third quarter of 2019; • an increase of $48.6 million due to the deliveries of the Sean Spirit, Bahrain Spirit and Yamal Spirit and commencement of their charter contracts;
• an increase of $33.2 million primarily due to higher charter rates earned in 2019 on the Torben Spirit and our seven multi-gas carriers; • an increase of $12.3 million due to the deliveries of the Magdala, Myrina and Megara following the commencement of their charter contracts in 2018; • an increase of $8.9 million due to the reclassification of Awilco vessels as sales-type leases in the fourth quarter of 2019, resulting in a gain on the derecognition of vessels in the same period;
• an increase of $6.0 million primarily due to a reduction in legal and other professional fees incurred in 2019. During 2018, professional fees included amounts relating to the tax treatment dispute relating to the lease of three LNG carriers (or the RasGas II LNG Carriers) in Teekay LNG's 70%-owned consolidated subsidiary Teekay Nakilat Corporation (or the RasGas II Joint Venture) and claims against a Norway-based marine transportation company, I.M. Skaugen SE, for damages and losses for Teekay LNG's seven multi-gas carriers previously on charter to them; and
• an increase of $3.2 million due to the Polar Spirit being off-hire for 35 days in 2018 primarily due to an incident investigation involving a collision with a small vessel and repositioning to other charters;
partially offset by
• a decrease of $9.1 million due to the Madrid Spirit and Galicia Spirit being off-hire for 82 days and 38 days in 2019, respectively, and the impact of the depreciation of the Euro on Teekay LNG's Euro-denominated revenue and Euro-denominated operating expenses, partially offset by the Catalunya Spirit being off-hire for 28 days in 2018 for a scheduled dry docking; and
• a decrease of $3.5 million due to decrease in operating expenses passed through to the charterer and due to declining revenue recognition for charter contracts accounted for as direct financing leases for the Tangguh Sago and Tangguh Hiri in 2019.
Equity income related to Teekay LNG’s liquefied gas carriers increased to $58.8 million in 2019 compared to $53.5 million in 2018. The changes were primarily a result of: • an increase of $23.3 million due to the deliveries of the Pan Americas, Pan Europe, Pan Africa, Rudolf Samoylovich, Nikolay Yevgenov, Vladimir Voronin, Georgiy Ushakov and Yakov Gakkel following the commencement of their charter contracts in 2018 and 2019;
• an increase of $8.8 million due to recognition of dry-dock revenue upon completion of a dry dock for the Meridian Spirit, higher charter rates earned for the Arwa Spirit and Marib Spirit on one-year fixed-rate charter contracts commencing in the third quarter of 2019, higher fleet utilization in 2019, and lower interest expense as a result of the refinancing completed in 2018 in Teekay LNG's 52%- owned investment in the LNG carriers relating to MALT LNG Carriers; and
• an increase of $7.9 million due to higher fixed and spot charter rates earned in Teekay LNG's 50%-ownership interest in Exmar LPG BVBA (or the Exmar LPG Joint Venture) compared to 2018;
partially offset by
• a decrease of $17.7 million due to mark-to-market changes for derivative instruments, resulting in the recognition of unrealized losses in 2019 compared to unrealized gains in 2018; • a decrease of $10.8 million due to the Bahrain Spirit floating storage unit chartered-in by the Bahrain LNG Joint Venture from Teekay LNG commencing in September 2018 not earning any sub-charter income in 2019; and • a decrease of $5.7 million due to a gain on the sale of Teekay LNG's interest in its 50%-owned joint venture with Exmar NV (or the Excelsior Joint Venture) recorded in 2018.
