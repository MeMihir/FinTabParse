crude oil , and political unrest in the middle east and elsewhere .
later in 2008 , crude oil prices dropped more rapidly than they had climbed as the u.s .
dollar rebounded and other countries entered recessions which decreased demand .
during 2008 , the average spot price per barrel for wti was $ 99.75 , up from an average of $ 72.41 in 2007 , but ended the year at $ 44.60 .
the average spot price per barrel for brent was $ 97.26 in 2008 , up from an average of $ 72.39 in 2007 , but ended the year at $ 36.55 .
the differential between wti and brent average prices widened to $ 2.49 in 2008 from $ 0.02 in 2007 .
our domestic crude oil production is on average heavier and higher in sulfur content than light sweet wti .
heavier and higher sulfur crude oil ( commonly referred to as heavy sour crude oil ) sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil .
our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and is generally sold in relation to the brent crude oil benchmark .
natural gas prices on average were higher in 2008 than in 2007 .
a significant portion of our u.s .
lower 48 states natural gas production is sold at bid-week prices or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas .
the average henry hub first-of-month price index was $ 2.18 per thousand cubic feet ( 201cmcf 201d ) higher in 2008 than the 2007 average .
natural gas sales in alaska are subject to term contracts .
our other major natural gas-producing regions are europe and equatorial guinea , where large portions of our natural gas sales are subject to term contracts , making realized prices in these areas less volatile .
as we sell larger quantities of natural gas from these regions , to the extent that these fixed prices are lower than prevailing prices , our reported average natural gas prices realizations may decrease .
e&p segment income during 2008 was up 57 percent from 2007 , with revenue increases tied to these increases in average commodity prices accounting for almost half of the income improvement .
liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes were also higher in 2008 than 2007 .
oil sands mining oil sands mining segment revenues correlate with prevailing market prices for the various qualities of synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil we produce .
roughly two-thirds of the normal output mix will track movements in wti and one-third will track movements in the canadian heavy sour crude oil marker , primarily western canadian select .
output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mine or upgrader .
during 2008 , our average realized price for synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil was $ 91.90 per barrel , up from 2007 , but ended the year at $ 24.97 per barrel impacted by a heavier yield in december and a seasonal decrease in the value of our heavy output .
the operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed , and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime .
per unit costs are sensitive to production rates .
key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel , which track commodity markets such as the canadian aeco natural gas sales index and crude prices respectively .
the table below shows benchmark prices that impact both our revenues and variable costs , listing high and low spot prices during the year. .

( b ) alberta energy company day ahead index .
our osm segment reported income of $ 258 million for 2008 , reflecting synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil sales averaging 32 mboepd .
derivative instruments intended to hedge price risk on future sales have impacted revenues in the periods presented , with net gains of $ 48 million in 2008 and net losses of $ 53 million in 2007 .
in the first quarter of 2009 , we entered into derivative instruments which effectively offset certain of our open derivative positions .
refining , marketing and transportation rm&t segment income depends largely on our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin , refinery throughputs , retail marketing gross margins for gasoline , distillates and merchandise , and the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations. .
