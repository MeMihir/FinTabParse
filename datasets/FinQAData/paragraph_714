notes to consolidated financial statements 2014 ( continued ) 16 .
financial instruments fuel hedges we have entered into multiple swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to mitigate some of our exposure related to changes in diesel fuel prices .
these swaps qualified for , and were designated as , effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases ( fuel hedges ) .
the following table summarizes our outstanding fuel hedges as of december 31 , 2015 : year gallons hedged weighted average contract price per gallon .
if the national u.s .
on-highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel as published by the department of energy exceeds the contract price per gallon , we receive the difference between the average price and the contract price ( multiplied by the notional gallons ) from the counterparty .
if the average price is less than the contract price per gallon , we pay the difference to the counterparty .
the fair values of our fuel hedges are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets ( level 2 in the fair value hierarchy ) .
the aggregate fair values of our outstanding fuel hedges as of december 31 , 2015 and 2014 were current liabilities of $ 37.8 million and $ 34.4 million , respectively , and have been recorded in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets .
the ineffective portions of the changes in fair values resulted in a loss of $ 0.4 million and $ 0.5 million for the years ended december 31 , 2015 and 2014 respectively , and a gain of less than $ 0.1 million for the year ended december 31 , 2013 , and have been recorded in other income , net in our consolidated statements of income .
total ( loss ) gain recognized in other comprehensive ( loss ) income for fuel hedges ( the effective portion ) was $ ( 2.0 ) million , $ ( 24.2 ) million and $ 2.4 million , for the years ended december 31 , 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively .
recycling commodity hedges revenue from the sale of recycled commodities is primarily from sales of old corrugated cardboard and old newspaper .
from time to time we use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities .
we had no outstanding recycling commodity hedges as of december 31 , 2015 and 2014 .
no amounts were recognized in other income , net in our consolidated statements of income for the ineffective portion of the changes in fair values during the years ended december 31 , 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
total gain ( loss ) recognized in other comprehensive income for recycling commodity hedges ( the effective portion ) was $ 0.1 million and $ ( 0.1 ) million for the years ended december 31 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively .
no amount was recognized in other comprehensive income for 2015 .
fair value measurements in measuring fair values of assets and liabilities , we use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs ( level 1 ) and minimize the use of unobservable inputs ( level 3 ) .
we also use market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability , including assumptions about risk when appropriate. .
