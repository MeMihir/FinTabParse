operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by $ 374 million to $ 3547 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 .
the increase primarily was attributable to an improvement in our operating working capital balances of $ 570 million as discussed below , and $ 187 million related to lower net income tax payments , as compared to 2009 .
partially offsetting these improvements was a net reduction in cash from operations of $ 350 million related to our defined benefit pension plan .
this reduction was the result of increased contributions to the pension trust of $ 758 million as compared to 2009 , partially offset by an increase in the cas costs recovered on our contracts .
operating working capital accounts consists of receivables , inventories , accounts payable , and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred .
the improvement in cash provided by operating working capital was due to a decline in 2010 accounts receivable balances compared to 2009 , and an increase in 2010 customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred balances compared to 2009 .
these improvements partially were offset by a decline in accounts payable balances in 2010 compared to 2009 .
the decline in accounts receivable primarily was due to higher collections on various programs at electronic systems , is&gs , and space systems business areas .

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $ 1248 million to $ 3173 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 .

partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower net income tax payments in 2009 as compared to 2008 in the amount of $ 319 million .
the decline in cash provided by operating working capital primarily was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the ms2 and gt&l lines of business at electronic systems and an increase in inventories on combat aircraft programs at aeronautics , which partially were offset by increases in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on government satellite programs at space systems and the timing of accounts payable activities .
