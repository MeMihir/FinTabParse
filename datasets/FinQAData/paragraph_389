regulatory developments resolution and recovery planning pursuant to the dodd-frank act , we are required to periodi- cally submit to the federal reserve and the fdic a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolu- tion under the u.s .
bankruptcy code in the event of our material financial distress or failure .
our preferred resolution strategy , which is set out in our 2017 resolution plan , is an spoe strategy .
we submitted our full 2017 resolution plan on june 30 , 2017 .
as indicated in our 2017 resolution plan , the parent company has amended and restated its support agreement with its material entities , as defined in our 2017 resolution plan .
under the secured amended and restated support agreement , upon the occur- rence of a resolution scenario , the parent company would be obligated to contribute or loan on a subordinated basis all of its contributable material assets , other than shares in subsidi- aries of the parent company and certain intercompany receiv- ables , to provide capital and liquidity , as applicable , to our material entities .
the obligations of the parent company under the secured amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the parent company ( other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company ) .
as a result , claims of our material entities against the assets of the parent company ( other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company ) are effectively senior to unsecured obliga- tions of the parent company .
in december 2017 , we received joint feedback on our 2017 resolution plan from the federal reserve and the fdic .

further , the federal reserve and the fdic have extended the next resolution plan filing deadline for eight large domestic banks , including us , by one year to july 1 , 2019 .
