gross margin decreased to 27.5% ( 27.5 % ) of net sales in 2003 from 27.9% ( 27.9 % ) of net sales in 2002 .
this decline in gross margin reflects relatively aggressive pricing actions on several macintosh models instituted by the company beginning in late fiscal 2002 as a result of continued pricing pressure throughout the personal computer industry , lower sales of relatively higher margin power macintosh systems during the first three fiscal quarters of 2003 , and increased air freight and manufacturing costs associated with the production ramp-up of the new power mac g5 and 15-inch powerbook , both of which began shipping in volume during september 2003 .
this decline is also attributable to a rise in certain component costs as the year progressed .
the aforementioned negative factors affecting gross margins during 2003 were partially offset by the increase in higher margin software and direct sales .
the company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2004 in light of weak economic conditions , price competition in the personal computer industry , and potential increases in component pricing .
the company also expects to continue to incur air freight charges on the power mac g5 and other products during 2004 .
the foregoing statements regarding the company 2019s expected gross margin during 2004 , general demand for personal computers , anticipated industry component pricing , anticipated air freight charges , and future economic conditions are forward-looking .
