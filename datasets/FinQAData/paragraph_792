the increases in 2006 and 2005 were driven by higher net income .
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis .
earnings represent income from continuing operations , less equity earnings net of distributions , plus fixed charges and income taxes .
fixed charges represent interest charges , amortization of debt discount , and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges .
