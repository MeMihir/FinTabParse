overview exploration and production prevailing prices for the various grades of crude oil and natural gas that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows .
prices were volatile in 2009 , but not as much as in the previous year .
prices in 2009 were also lower than in recent years as illustrated by the annual averages for key benchmark prices below. .
henry hub natural gas ( dollars per mcf ) ( a ) $ 3.99 $ 9.04 $ 6.86 ( a ) first-of-month price index .
crude oil prices rose sharply through the first half of 2008 as a result of strong global demand , a declining dollar , ongoing concerns about supplies of crude oil , and geopolitical risk .
later in 2008 , crude oil prices sharply declined as the u.s .
dollar rebounded and global demand decreased as a result of economic recession .
the price decrease continued into 2009 , but reversed after dropping below $ 33.98 in february , ending the year at $ 79.36 .
our domestic crude oil production is about 62 percent sour , which means that it contains more sulfur than light sweet wti does .
sour crude oil also tends to be heavier than light sweet crude oil and sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil because of higher refining costs and lower refined product values .
our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and is generally sold in relation to the dated brent crude benchmark .
the differential between wti and dated brent average prices narrowed to $ 0.42 in 2009 compared to $ 2.49 in 2008 and $ 0.02 in 2007. .
