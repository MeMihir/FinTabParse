we hold an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the benchmark interest rate of our $ 375 million 5.0% ( 5.0 % ) senior unsecured notes due july 1 , 2014 .
the effect of the swap is to convert our 5.0% ( 5.0 % ) fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate based on the three-month libor plus 2.05% ( 2.05 % ) ( 2.42% ( 2.42 % ) as of october 29 , 2011 ) .
in addition , we have a term loan facility of $ 145 million that bears interest at a fluctuating rate for each period equal to the libor rate corresponding with the tenor of the interest period plus a spread of 1.25% ( 1.25 % ) ( 1.61% ( 1.61 % ) as of october 29 , 2011 ) .
if libor increases by 100 basis points , our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $ 5 million .
however , this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on our $ 375 million of 3% ( 3 % ) fixed-rate debt , which is not hedged .
as of october 30 , 2010 , a similar 100 basis point increase in libor would have resulted in an increase of approximately $ 4 million to our annual interest expense .
foreign currency exposure as more fully described in note 2i in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k , we regularly hedge our non-u.s .
dollar-based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts .
the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months .
currently , our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro , primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses .
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october 29 , 2011 and october 30 , 2010 , a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of the year would expose us to approximately $ 6 million in losses in earnings or cash flows .
the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rates that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions , assets and liabilities being hedged .
the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings .
based on the credit ratings of our counterparties as of october 29 , 2011 , we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by them .
while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions , they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk .
the amounts potentially subject to credit risk ( arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts ) are generally limited to the amounts , if any , by which the counterparties 2019 obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties .
the following table illustrates the effect that a 10% ( 10 % ) unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates , relative to the u.s .
dollar , would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of october 29 , 2011 and october 30 , 2010: .

$ ( 13332 ) $ ( 7396 ) the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the u.s .
dollar .
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates , such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors 2019 products become more or less attractive .
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices. .
