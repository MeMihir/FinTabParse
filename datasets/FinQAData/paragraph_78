as such , we generally have not recognized compensation expense for options granted to employees .
we will adopt the provisions of sfas 123r under the modified prospective method , in which compensation cost for all share-based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of sfas 123r , and compensation cost for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that are unvested as of the effective date of sfas 123r is recognized based on sfas 123 .
tax benefits will be recognized related to the cost for share-based payments to the extent the equity instrument would ordinarily result in a future tax deduction under existing law .
tax expense will be recognized to write off excess deferred tax assets when the tax deduction upon settlement of a vested option is less than the expense recorded in the statement of operations ( to the extent not offset by prior tax credits for settlements where the tax deduction was greater than the fair value cost ) .
we estimate that we will recognize equity-based compensation expense of approximately $ 35 million to $ 38 million for the year ending december 31 , 2006 .
this amount is subject to revisions as we finalize certain assumptions related to 2006 , including the size and nature of awards and forfeiture rates .
sfas 123r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as operating cash flow as was previously required .
we cannot estimate what the future tax benefits will be as the amounts depend on , among other factors , future employee stock option exercises .
due to the our tax loss position , there was no operating cash inflow realized for december 31 , 2005 and 2004 for such excess tax deductions .
