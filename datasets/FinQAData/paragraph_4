following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2003 to 2002. .
the deferred fuel cost revisions variance resulted from a revised unbilled sales pricing estimate made in december 2002 and a further revision made in the first quarter of 2003 to more closely align the fuel component of that pricing with expected recoverable fuel costs .
the asset retirement obligation variance was due to the implementation of sfas 143 , "accounting for asset retirement obligations" adopted in january 2003 .
see "critical accounting estimates" for more details on sfas 143 .
the increase was offset by decommissioning expense and had no effect on net income .
