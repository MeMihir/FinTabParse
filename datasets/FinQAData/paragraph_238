( 14 ) financial instruments we are exposed to capital market risk , such as changes in interest rates .
in an effort to manage interest rate risk , we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time .
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes .
in november 2007 , we entered into forward starting interest swaps with notional amounts appropriate to hedge interest rates on $ 300.0 million of anticipated debt offerings in 2009 .
the forward starting swaps were appropriately designated and tested for effectiveness as cash flow hedges .
in march 2008 , we settled the forward starting swaps and made a cash payment of $ 14.6 million to the counterparties .
an effectiveness test was performed as of the settlement date and it was concluded that a highly effective cash flow hedge was still in place for the expected debt offering .
of the amount paid in settlement , approximately $ 700000 was immediately reclassified to interest expense , as the result of partial ineffectiveness calculated at the settlement date .
the net amount of $ 13.9 million was recorded in other comprehensive income ( 201coci 201d ) and is being recognized through interest expense over the life of the hedged debt offering , which took place in may 2008 .
the remaining unamortized amount included as a reduction to accumulated oci as of december 31 , 2009 is $ 9.3 million .
in august 2005 , we entered into $ 300.0 million of cash flow hedges through forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge interest rates on $ 300.0 million of anticipated debt offerings in 2007 .
the swaps qualified for hedge accounting , with any changes in fair value recorded in oci .
in conjunction with the september 2007 issuance of $ 300.0 million of senior unsecured notes , we terminated these cash flow hedges as designated .
the settlement amount received of $ 10.7 million is being recognized to earnings through a reduction of interest expense over the term of the hedged cash flows .
the remaining unamortized amount included as an increase to accumulated oci as of december 31 , 2009 is $ 8.2 million .
the ineffective portion of the hedge was insignificant .
the effectiveness of our hedges is evaluated throughout their lives using the hypothetical derivative method under which the change in fair value of the actual swap designated as the hedging instrument is compared to the change in fair value of a hypothetical swap .
we had no material interest rate derivatives , when considering both fair value and notional amount , at december 31 , 2009. .
