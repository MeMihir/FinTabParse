we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups .
freight revenues vary with volume ( carloads ) and average revenue per car ( arc ) .
changes in price , traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc .
we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations , which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments .
we recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination .
we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them .
other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries , revenues from our commuter rail operations , and accessorial revenues , which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage .
we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations .
