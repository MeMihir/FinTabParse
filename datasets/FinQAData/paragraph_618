at december 31 , 2015 and 2014 , we had a modest working capital surplus .
this reflects a strong cash position that provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment .
in addition , we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements , and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities .
cash flows .
operating activities cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower net income and changes in working capital , partially offset by the timing of tax payments .
federal tax law provided for 100% ( 100 % ) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 and 50% ( 50 % ) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012-2013 .
as a result , the company deferred a substantial portion of its 2011-2013 income tax expense , contributing to the positive operating cash flow in those years .
congress extended 50% ( 50 % ) bonus depreciation for 2014 , but this extension occurred in december , and the related benefit was realized in 2015 , rather than 2014 .
similarly , in december of 2015 , congress extended bonus depreciation through 2019 , which delayed the benefit of 2015 bonus depreciation into 2016 .
bonus depreciation will be at a rate of 50% ( 50 % ) for 2015 , 2016 and 2017 , 40% ( 40 % ) for 2018 and 30% ( 30 % ) for 2019 .
higher net income in 2014 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2013 , despite higher income tax payments .
2014 income tax payments were higher than 2013 primarily due to higher income , but also because we paid taxes previously deferred by bonus depreciation .
investing activities higher capital investments in locomotives and freight cars , including $ 327 million in early lease buyouts , which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions , drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014 .
higher capital investments , including the early buyout of the long-term operating lease of our headquarters building for approximately $ 261 million , drove the increase in cash used in investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013 .
significant investments also were made for new locomotives , freight cars and containers , and capacity and commercial facility projects .
capital investments in 2014 also included $ 99 million for the early buyout of locomotives and freight cars under long-term operating leases , which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions. .
