the aes corporation notes to consolidated financial statements 2014 ( continued ) december 31 , 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 the following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for the periods indicated ( in millions ) : .
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently under examination by the relevant taxing authorities for various tax years .
the company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded .
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position , we believe we have appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits .
however , audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty .
it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could be material , but cannot be estimated as of december 31 , 2016 .
our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted .
