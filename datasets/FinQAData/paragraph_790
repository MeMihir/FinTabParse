tissue pulp due to strong market demand , partic- ularly from asia .
average sales price realizations improved significantly in 2007 , principally reflecting higher average prices for softwood , hardwood and fluff pulp .
operating earnings in 2007 were $ 104 mil- lion compared with $ 48 million in 2006 and $ 37 mil- lion in 2005 .
the benefits from higher sales price realizations were partially offset by increased input costs for energy , chemicals and freight .
entering the first quarter of 2008 , demand for market pulp remains strong , and average sales price realiza- tions should increase slightly .
however , input costs for energy , chemicals and freight are expected to be higher , and increased spending is anticipated for planned mill maintenance outages .
industrial packaging demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods pro- duction , as well as with demand for processed foods , poultry , meat and agricultural products .
in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs , freight costs , manufacturing effi- ciency and product mix .
industrial packaging net sales for 2007 increased 6% ( 6 % ) to $ 5.2 billion compared with $ 4.9 bil- lion in 2006 , and 13% ( 13 % ) compared with $ 4.6 billion in 2005 .
operating profits in 2007 were 26% ( 26 % ) higher than in 2006 and more than double 2005 earnings .
bene- fits from improved price realizations ( $ 147 million ) , sales volume increases net of increased lack of order downtime ( $ 3 million ) , a more favorable mix ( $ 31 million ) , strong mill and converting operations ( $ 33 million ) and other costs ( $ 47 million ) were partially offset by the effects of higher raw material costs ( $ 76 million ) and higher freight costs ( $ 18 million ) .
in addition , a gain of $ 13 million was recognized in 2006 related to a sale of property in spain and costs of $ 52 million were incurred in 2007 related to the conversion of the paper machine at pensacola to production of lightweight linerboard .
the segment took 165000 tons of downtime in 2007 which included 16000 tons of market-related downtime compared with 135000 tons of downtime in 2006 of which none was market-related .

north american industrial packaging net sales for 2007 were $ 3.9 billion , compared with $ 3.7 billion in 2006 and $ 3.6 billion in 2005 .
operating profits in 2007 were $ 407 million , up from $ 327 mil- lion in 2006 and $ 170 million in 2005 .
containerboard shipments were higher in 2007 compared with 2006 , including production from the paper machine at pensacola that was converted to lightweight linerboard during 2007 .
average sales price realizations were significantly higher than in 2006 reflecting price increases announced early in 2006 and in the third quarter of 2007 .
margins improved reflecting stronger export demand .
manu- facturing performance was strong , although costs associated with planned mill maintenance outages were higher due to timing of outages .
raw material costs for wood , energy , chemicals and recycled fiber increased significantly .
operating results for 2007 were also unfavorably impacted by $ 52 million of costs associated with the conversion and startup of the pensacola paper machine .
u.s .
converting sales volumes were slightly lower in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting softer customer box demand .
earnings improvement in 2007 bene- fited from the realization of box price increases announced in early 2006 and late 2007 .
favorable manufacturing operations and higher sales prices for waste fiber more than offset significantly higher raw material and freight costs .
looking ahead to the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes are expected to increase slightly , and results should benefit from a full-quarter impact of the price increases announced in the third quarter of 2007 .
however , additional mill maintenance outages are planned for the first quarter , and freight and input costs are expected to rise , particularly for wood and energy .
manufacturing operations should be favorable compared with the fourth quarter .
european industrial packaging net sales for 2007 were $ 1.1 billion , up from $ 1.0 billion in 2006 and $ 880 million in 2005 .
sales volumes were about flat as early stronger demand in the industrial segment weakened in the second half of the year .
operating profits in 2007 were $ 88 million compared with $ 69 million in 2006 and $ 53 million in 2005 .
sales margins improved reflecting increased sales prices for boxes .
conversion costs were favorable as the result of manufacturing improvement programs .
entering the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes should be strong seasonally across all regions as the winter fruit and vegetable season continues .
profit margins , however , are expected to be somewhat lower. .
