during 2013 , we settled with the irs appeals division and the joint committee on taxation our 2009 and 2010 tax years .
the resolution of these tax periods in addition to various state tax resolutions during the year reduced our gross unrecognized tax benefits by $ 20.7 million .
included in our gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 , 2015 and 2014 are $ 30.5 million and $ 45.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits ( net of the federal benefit on state matters ) that , if recognized , would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods .
we recognize interest and penalties as incurred within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income .
related to the unrecognized tax benefits previously noted , we recorded interest expense of approximately $ 1.2 million during 2015 and , in total as of december 31 , 2015 , have recognized a liability for penalties of $ 0.5 million and interest of $ 10.3 million .
during 2014 , we accrued interest of approximately $ 1.5 million and , in total as of december 31 , 2014 , had recognized a liability for penalties of $ 0.5 million and interest of $ 18.7 million .

gross unrecognized benefits that we expect to settle in the following twelve months are in the range of $ 0 to $ 10 million ; however , it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may either increase or decrease in the next twelve months .
we are currently under examination or administrative review by state and local taxing authorities for various tax years .
these state audits are ongoing .
we believe the recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions are adequate .
however , a significant assessment against us in excess of the liabilities recorded could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position , results of operations or cash flows. .
