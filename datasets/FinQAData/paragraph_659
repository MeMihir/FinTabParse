operating environment .
following difficult market conditions and the impact of a challenging macroeconomic environment on corporate performance , particularly in the energy sector , in the first quarter of 2016 , market conditions improved during the rest of the year as macroeconomic concerns moderated .
global equity markets increased during 2016 , contributing to net gains from investments in public equities , and corporate performance rebounded from the difficult start to the year .
if macroeconomic concerns negatively affect corporate performance or company-specific events , or if global equity markets decline , net revenues in investing & lending would likely be negatively impacted .
although net revenues in investing & lending for 2015 benefited from favorable company-specific events , including sales , initial public offerings and financings , a decline in global equity prices and widening high-yield credit spreads during the second half of 2015 impacted results .
2016 versus 2015 .
net revenues in investing & lending were $ 4.08 billion for 2016 , 25% ( 25 % ) lower than 2015 .
this decrease was primarily due to significantly lower net revenues from investments in equities , primarily reflecting a significant decrease in net gains from private equities , driven by company-specific events and corporate performance .
in addition , net revenues in debt securities and loans were lower compared with 2015 , reflecting significantly lower net revenues related to relationship lending activities , due to the impact of changes in credit spreads on economic hedges .

this decrease was partially offset by higher net gains from investments in debt instruments and higher net interest income .
