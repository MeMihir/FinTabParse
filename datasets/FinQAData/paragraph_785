seasonality could have an impact on the timing of accruals if the sales in the last two quarters of the year do not materialize .
the level of our working capital generally reflects the seasonality and growth in our business .
we generally expect inventory , accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season. .
