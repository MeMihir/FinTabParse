cash flows millions 2014 2013 2012 .
operating activities higher net income in 2014 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2013 , despite higher income tax payments .
2014 income tax payments were higher than 2013 primarily due to higher income , but also because we paid taxes previously deferred by bonus depreciation ( discussed below ) .
higher net income in 2013 increased cash provided by operating activities compared to 2012 .
in addition , we made payments in 2012 for past wages as a result of national labor negotiations , which reduced cash provided by operating activities in 2012 .
lower tax benefits from bonus depreciation ( as discussed below ) partially offset the increases .
federal tax law provided for 100% ( 100 % ) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2011 and 50% ( 50 % ) bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during 2012-2013 .

capital investments in 2014 also included $ 99 million for the early buyout of locomotives and freight cars under long-term operating leases , which we exercised due to favorable economic terms and market conditions .
